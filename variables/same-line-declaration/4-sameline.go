// Same Line Declarations
// We are able to declare multiple variables on the same line:

// mileage, company := 80276, "Tesla"

// // is the same as

// mileage := 80276
// company := "Tesla"
// Assignment
// Within the main function, declare a float called averageOpenRate and string called displayMessage on the same line.

// Initialize them to values of .23 and is the average open rate of your messages respectively before they are printed.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	averageOpenRate, displayMessage := 0.23, "is the average open rate of your messages"
	fmt.Println(averageOpenRate, displayMessage)
}
